- choice is intended to give the user a level of control over webpage content of certain domains
- as a baseline, ability to hide unwanted page elements

## rationale

- the idea is to hide distructing page elements on certain domains
- there are extensions specific to domains (google doodle blocker, youtube hide recommends etc.)
- still it seems there is no multi-domain extension that would let you choose what is displayed (google,youtube, github, twitter, medium, stackoverflow etc.)
- 'distruction free youtube' extension is not open source and asks access for browsing history (maybe it's for a reason, but I'm reluctant to install) 
- and in general: web services change their UI, new services appear; content-clearing tool that can be quickly adjusted is needed
<br/>
<br/>

- internet is vital
- free open-minded people created a tool to make information accessible
- but 'hey, let's do this, it will be amazing' eventually is pushed away by 'how do we maximize' and shove-selling
- as a result, services make sure you click as much as possible
- let's not mix complacency and lack of integrity of marketing with the amazing product of engineering teams
- there should be opt-in policy for ads and certain parts of interface; alas..

## minimum viable product

- hide google doodle
- hide youtube distructions
- not domain specific

## possibilities

- toggle what to display per domain
- ability to customize (css, cljs?)
- create github issues from extension interface
- backup your settings/code (maybe in a github repo)
- versions as dates
- domains of interest : google youtube github thesaurus twitter stackoverflow ...
