- choice is intended to give the user a level of control over webpage content of certain domains

## rationale

- the idea is to toggle page elements on certain domains
- there are extensions specific to domains (google doodle blocker, youtube hide recommends etc.)
- still it seems there is no multi-domain extension that would let you choose what is displayed (google,youtube, github, twitter, medium, stackoverflow etc.)
- 'destruction free youtube' extension is not open source and asks access for browsing history (maybe it's for a reason, but I'm reluctant to install) 
- and in general: web services change their UI, new services appear; content-clearing tool that can be quickly adjusted is needed

## mvp

- hide google doodle
- hide youtube destructions
- not domain specific

## possibilities

- toggle what to display per domain
- ability to customize (css, cljs?)
- create github issues from extension interface
- backup your settings/code (maybe in a github repo)
- versions as dates
- domains of interest : google youtube github thesaurus twitter stackoverflow ...
